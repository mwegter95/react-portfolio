# mwegter95 React Portfolio

This is challenge 20 of the U of MN Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

It includes a single-page app powered by React that shows my portfolio for tech projects.

[//]: # (hidden message that says I'm thinking I make this personal by getting tons of examples and documenting lots of projects. This is about me loving and knowing how to code for a very long time. Put a lot out there.)

I love to code!
